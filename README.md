# 🗣️ VoiceCraft – AI-Powered Sign Language Translator

VoiceCraft is a Flutter-based accessibility application that enables real-time **gesture-to-text translation** to bridge communication gaps between sign language users and non-signers. The application leverages computer vision and AI to translate sign language gestures into readable text with near real-time feedback.

This project focuses on **accessibility, inclusivity, and real-time AI-driven interaction**.

## 🧠 System Architecture

Camera Input → Gesture Capture → AI Model (Gemini 2.5 Pro)  
→ Gesture Classification → Text Translation → UI Display

The application processes camera frames in real time, sends relevant gesture data to the AI model, and displays translated text directly in the user interface.
